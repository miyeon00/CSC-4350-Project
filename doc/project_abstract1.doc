What is your product, on a high level?
A website for providing feedback from students to instructors in as timely a fashion as possible. 

Whom is it for?
Students wishing to provide feedback(/criticism) along with instructors wishing to receive feedback on their instruction

What problem does it solve?
Miscommunication between instructors and students, along with facilitating more frequent updates.

What alternatives are available?
RateMyProfessor

Why is this project compelling and worth developing?
Sometimes the labs have varying quality and thus being able to provide feedback would help future classes have better instruction/instructional material


What are the competitors and what is novel in your approach?
RateMyProfessor only provides a semester scope and thus tends to lead to a lot of hyperbole in the reviews from pent up frustrations. Also the criticism is less directed at the material and more towards the instructor, and is typically used as a warning systems for future students then a method of constructive criticism unlike our product.

Make it clear that the system can be built, making good use of the available resources and technology.
Websites that access databases with rankings and are intended to provide feedback already exist, just not for the specific purpose of our project.

Do you have a client login and a admin login?
Yes, Instructors as admin and client will be those taking the Labs
What if we let Admins view but not modify other classes teaching the same material as them?
Simply to differentiate them from clients along with that ability for them to view a wider range of feedback
